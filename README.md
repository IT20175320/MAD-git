Pet-Care
In my part Iâ€™m going to work with pet care section. In this section there are some static pages too. I used some principles and components. I also used components such as confirmation, alert, keyboard variation in the principles of user inputs. I also used different icons for this. I also used various buttons and a text field. In my case if customer wants to get some ideas about doctor details, teach their dogs or pharmacy items they can choose the relevant buttons. And they cannot change any things to that pages. But they can search some items in that pages. 
After press appointment button customer can create a new note by giving details about his/her appointment and save it. After submitting this form, the data is saved in our database. If he/she wants to update their details he/she can use update option. After he update successfully, he/she can see toast message if he/she wants to cancel appointment he/she can use delete option(optional).
