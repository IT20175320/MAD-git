Introduction to the Project

Pets are also considered as family. Treating the pet good with best food and products will always keep them happy. Keeping your pet happy will result in the owner’s happiness too. However, finding all pet food and products related to pets consumes a lot of time. Not only that for the wellbeing of the pet the pet should be sent to checkups in regular basis, but then again finding the veterinarians and other related person’s is not very easy in this busy routing. “Petopia” is a single app which contains all pet related features such as where to buy pet food, and other related products related to pets, placing notes for doctor appointments, and also the interesting feature such as to share their pet moments in this app allowing the users to interact with other registered users who also own different kinds of pets.

“Petopia” allows new users to register into the app by creating a new profile by providing all the basic details of the pets and owner and also upload a profile picture to the account. These users could also update their profile details based on some limitations. After Successfully completing the registration to the app. This enables the users to obtain the features such as Pet care, Food, and products and Moments. In Pet Care feature the users can set a note for appointments to reach the veterinarians and also view the details of doctors and popular pharmacy products. Also, in Pet Care section there is a separate feature called “Teach you Dog”, which provides instructions on how to train and maintain good health of a dog. The Food and Products feature allows the user to view the pet foods and products related to pets which have posted by other users. Any user can post pet food or products to sale in this section. User can also add items to a cart to review later and even the user can delete items from the cart. “Petopia” also contains a blog feature called Moments. This allows the registered users to share their pet moments by creating a blog post which could includes a highlight of the moment the user is going to post along with a description. The user can also upload a picture sharing their moment with the pet or can remove the pictures which have already shared. This allows the registered users in the app to interact with other.
